## Online JOB Portal-App
According to a my idea I developed this application for the job seekers who are willing to find
jobs and who are willing to post jobs, from this I needed to reduce the distance between the job
seeker and vacancies, I also implement online interview System via WebRTC.


## Motivation
Motivate Companies and employees from a better way without wasting their time with going here and there for finding jobs, posting articles in news papaers and from other ways.
